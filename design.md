# Design
sub_system: true
state_machine: true
terminologies:
  - term: Device
    definition: Pine, the entire electronics with embedded firmware and associated software
  - term: Ideal temperature
    definition: Desired room temperature as configured by the first-time user
  - term: Power on
    definition: A DPST switch to power on the entire device
  - term: Power off
    definition: A DPST switch to power off the entire device
  - term: Start button
    definition: A push button to start the device function every interval for a duration of time
  - term: ON command
    definition: Array of raw IR code to turn on the aircon at a certain temperature
  - term: OFF command
    definition: Array of raw IR code to turn off the aircon
  - term: Interval
    definition: Time period after which the device will check for room temperature and turn on or off the aircon E.g. 30 minutes
  - term: Duration
    definition: Length of total time during which the device will start functioning and then stop until it is started again
  - term: Ideal temperature
    definition: Desired room temperature as configured by the first-time user

user_stories:
  - user: first-time user
    actions:
      - goal: save the ON command of the aircon remote controller
        reason: it can be stored and replayed
      - goal: save the OFF command of the aircon remote controller
        reason: it can be stored and replayed
      - goal: configure the interval time for checking the room temperature
        reason: it can wakeup periodically to check the temperature
      - goal: configure the total period of time when the device should be checking the temperature
        reason: it can stop checking the temperature to regulate the room environment after a while
      - goal: configure the ideal room temperature
        reason: it can turn ON/OFF the aircon according to the measured temperature
  - user: user
    actions:
      - goal: turn ON the device with an on-board button
        reason: it can measure the current temperature and turn ON/OFF the aircon periodically
      - goal: turn OFF the device with an on-board button
        reason: it can measure the current temperature and turn ON/OFF the aircon periodically
      - goal: replace the battery
        reason: the device can be powered again
      - goal: turn ON the aircon automatically
        reason: the room becomes cooler towards my ideal temperature
      - goal: turn OFF the aircon automatically
        reason: the room becomes warmer towards my ideal temperature
      - goal: place the device on a vertical surface in line of sight with the aircon
        reason: it can communicate with the aircon via infrared
        reason: it can send the ON command to the aircon
      - goal: know whether the room temperature is colder or warmer than the ideal temperature through an on-board LED
        reason: it can send the OFF command to the aircon
features:
  - name: Store 2 arrays of about 300 elements of 12-bit integer for raw IR code
  - name: Flash in a program with sufficient memory containing IRLib2 with both IR emitter and receiver, compression algorithm. <code> Sketch uses 5476 bytes (16%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes. Global variables use 2156 bytes (105%) of dynamic memory, leaving -108 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.</code> Not enough memory; see <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#size">Troubleshooting Guide</a> for tips on reducing your footprint.
  - name: Sleep and wakeup periodically with a timer
  - name: Support Web USB protocol
  - name: Support I2C protocol for temperature sensor
